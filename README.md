# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning


Predicting the condition of the patient in the case of heart disease is really important. It would be good if a patient could get to know the condition before itself rather than visiting the doctor. With the aid of machine learning, it is possible to get to know the condition of a patient whether he/she would have a heart disease or not based on a few features such as glucose levels and so on. Using machine learning algorithms, we are going to predict the chances of a person suffering from a heart disease. In other words, we would be using various machine learning models for the prediction of the chances of a heart disease in a patient. Some of the input features that we would be considering in this example are blood pressure, chest pain type and cholestrol levels. This is just a sample dataset with 303 rows. This is created just to understand different classification machine learning algorithms and sklearn implementation of them.

There are many classification metrics that should be taken into consideration when performing the machine learning analysis. Considering the metrics, it is possible evaluate the performance of different machine learning and deep learning models respectively. We would be tabulating the results for this particular dataset. We would be looking at various machine learning models and understanding their hyperparameters in the process so as to build the best version of the models.

In addition to this, we would also be plotting various graphs and understanding the relationships between various features in the dataset. We would first check if there are any null values in the data. After doing that step, we would then understand how the data is spread and their overall percentile values. We would be plotting the graphs and trying to see if there is any feature that could be reduced if there is a correlation. 

We would consider various important classification metrics for different machine learning models using the sklearn library from python. We would be using these tools to calculate the accuracy, precision and recall to name a few. For each machine learning model, we would then be drawing and tabulating the results at the end so that one would get a good idea about which algorithm did the best in each metric. One thing to keep in mind is that this is just a very small data set which is used just to understand the machine learning models and implement them easily. Therefore, one can go to use much more complex datasets by keeping these steps in mind while doing the execution.
