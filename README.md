# Heart Disease Prediction Using Various Machine Learning Techniques

We would be using various machine learning models for the prediction of the chances of a heart disease in a patient. Some of the import features that we would be considering in this example are blood pressure, chest pain type and cholestrol levels. This is just a sample dataset with 303 rows. This is created just to understand different classification machine learning algorithms and sklearn implementation of it.
