# Heart Disease Prediction Using Various Machine Learning Techniques

We would be using various machine learning models for the prediction of the chances of a heart disease in a patient. Some of the input features that we would be considering in this example are blood pressure, chest pain type and cholestrol levels. This is just a sample dataset with 303 rows. This is created just to understand different classification machine learning algorithms and sklearn implementation of them. 

We would be considering many classification metrics and be comparing them with different classification machine learning algorithms. We would be tabulating the results for this particular dataset. We would be looking at various machine learning models and understanding their hyperparameters in the process so as to build the best version of the models.

In addition to this, we would also we plotting various graphs and understanding the relationships between various features in the dataset. We would first check if there are any null values in the data. After doing that step, we would then understand how the data is spread and their overall percentile values. We would be plotting the graphs and trying to see if there is any feature that could be reduced if there is a correlation.
