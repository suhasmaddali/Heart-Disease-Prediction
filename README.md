# Heart Disease Prediction Using Various Machine Learning Techniques

We would be using various machine learning models for the prediction of the chances of a heart disease in a patient. Some of the input features that we would be considering in this example are blood pressure, chest pain type and cholestrol levels. This is just a sample dataset with 303 rows. This is created just to understand different classification machine learning algorithms and sklearn implementation of it. 

We would be considering many classification metrics and be comparing them with different classification machine learning algorithms. We would be tabulating the results for this particular dataset.
